# Ecommerce_Linear_Regression_Project
This notebook looks at analyzing some user data from a fictional E-commerce company operating out of New York City. There are a few data visualizations, some data cleansing and some column and row manipulations as well then we can answer some business questions using a simple linear regression model to help guide our data to a very clean model.
The repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the data as well as the .csv file where all the data was taken from as well.
